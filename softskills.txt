2.What did u learn during ur training? What was easy? What was Challenging? How did u over come the challenges?

	A lot of things I learned from my training, not only in technical side but also in my non-technical(soft skills).

	 Actually I didn't even know about JAVA, I knew only the basic things of C & C++ programming lang., after came here I learned it and I came to know what is programming how it is worked.This was challenging for and I over came by learning, & practising with the help of trainers and my friends.

	In my soft skills side, my fear is to speak in front of everyone.But due to the activity we've done during the sessions I'm getting out of my stage fear.

3. 3.	What projects were you apart of during your engineering studies? What was your contribution to the project? What role did you play in the project team? Were there any challenges that you and team faced during the project? How did you all overcome them?

	I had done 75% of UI desiging for mobile application while working as an Mobile App Developer. As it is a start-up company no one is there to guide me or no seniors in mob app development. I'm the only one who took care of all the challenges in the project. But there is an advantage that, I learned many things during the designing UI.

4.a. You are a part of a team which is involved in a project. At one time none of the senior people in the project are available. There is a call on the landline. A client is trying to reach one of the senior team members but as there is no response on their mobile, the call is on the landline. There is a major issue with a project and the client needs some response. You do not know how to handle this situation. What will you do? 

	I will receive call and apologise to client for not responding and inform that our seniors are in another meeting with higher officials and the whatever the issues in the project, we're going through it and i tell,  I'll ask my one of senior's to connect with you once the meeting get over.Also, I'll note down the issue of the project.
----------------------------------------------------------

b.There is a disagreement between you and another team member. What is the course of action you will take? 

	In that case, directly I'll go and speak with the respective person and i'll share my point of view and also listen that person's concern and will try to solve them.
-------------------------------------------------------

c.There is a confusion in your mind about how to go about a task assigned to you. What would you like to do? 

	In this case, first I'll try to get the solution by myself and will make some rough drafts and then I'll go to the person who assigned a task and will get a clarification.
-------------------------------------------------------
d.You are suddenly asked to give a presentation on behalf of a colleague who is not well. How will you handle this situation? 

	However, I'll have some time before starting the presentation, I'll utilize that time to prepare and will refer the notes taken by my colleague and will give my best.
